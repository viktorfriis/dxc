      <div class="column">
        <p>Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business
          Central provides the same rich
          functionality as Microsoft Dynamics
          NAV — Microsoft’s flagship solution for the
          mid-size market that is used by over
          160,000 companies worldwide.</p>
        <p>Both solutions offer tight integration with
          other Microsoft cloud-based solutions
          such as Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Sales,
          Microsoft Office 365, etc.</p>
        <p>Microsoft describes Business Central
          as: “An all-in-one business management
          solution that helps organizations
          streamline business processes, improve
          customer interactions and enable growth.”</p>
        <h2>Business Central vs. Dynamics NAV</h2>
        <h3>Standard functionality</h3>

        <p>
          Just like Microsoft Dynamics NAV, Business Central functionality is divided across two packs. <br />
          Essentials maps 1:1 to the functionality provided in the Dynamics NAV Starter Pack, and Premium maps to the
          Dynamics NAV Extended Pack.<br />
          The table below shows the high-levelfunctional areas that are addressed by both solutions.

          <h2>Key areas of comparison</h2>
          <h2>Enhancing the solutions</h2>
          <li>Business Central can be enhanced only with
            “apps” purchased through Microsoft AppSource.
            <br>There is no custom development.<br> All apps are
            approved and published by Microsoft. It is possible
            to customize Business Central through tenant- or
            customer-specific extensions created and uploaded
            to the tenant by partners.</li><br>
          <li>Dynamics NAV can be enhanced through
            “extensions” purchased through the partner
            channel (pre-built enhancements that are approved
            by Microsoft) and through custom development.
            Customers can also skill-up and manage their
            own development.<br><br>
            Features for menu design, creating reports, etc. are
            included as standard in both solutions.</li>

          <h2>Hosting options</h2>
          <li>Business Central is hosted by Microsoft on Azure
            in a public cloud.</li><br>
          <li>Dynamics NAV can be deployed on Azure, in a
            private data center or on premises.</li>
          <h2>Licensing</h2>
          <li>Business Central uses subscription licensing that
            includes the application, hosting and maintenance
            in one per-user monthly fee.</li><br>
          <li>Dynamics NAV is available with perpetual or
            subscription-based licensing for the application (for
            subscription, the monthly fee includes maintenance);
            hosting is an additional cost.</li>
          <h2>Accessing the solutions</h2>
          <li>Business Central is accessed through a web client
            (a browser) and mobile apps for smart phones and
            tablets.</li>
          <li>Dynamics NAV is accessed through a PC client
            (the Windows client), web and mobile app.</li>
          <p>Both solutions also offer access directly from Outlook.</p>
        </ul>


        <ul>
          <h2>Which is the right solution for you?</h2>
          <p>Both solutions are aimed at the mid-size market.
            Business Central is priced to be attractive to larger
            SMBs and smaller organizations as they outgrow their
            entry-level accounting solutions and look for their first
            ERP solution</p>
          <li>Business Central is aimed primarily at new users
            whose needs are well met by standard software. As
            the AppSource offerings mature and increase, more
            complex users will see this solution as a viable option.
          </li>
          <li>Dynamics NAV is aimed at users with complex
            needs (where enhancements are required) and for
            those who require an on-premises solution.</li>
